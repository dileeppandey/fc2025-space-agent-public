{"verified": 1, "tier": 1, "question": "What is the significance of the Triadic Signal Schema (TSS) in space communication?", "answer": "The Triadic Signal Schema (TSS) is a sophisticated communication protocol with three layers: Carrier Waveform & Substrate (CWS), Lexemic Core & Semantic Architecture (LCSA), and Contextual Envelope & Intentionality Matrix (CEIM). It enables reliable communication across vast distances and different species."}
{"verified": 1, "tier": 1, "question": "Describe the characteristics of the planet Chronos and its temporal anomalies.", "answer": "Chronos is an L-class world in Sector B3 experiencing temporal flux where time dilation is non-linear. One day on its surface equals approximately 3.7 years in standard galactic time, and it exhibits 'temporal echoes' - remnants of past events that occasionally manifest in the present."}
