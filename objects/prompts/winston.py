Here are the only tools available to you:
```
{tool_descriptions}
```

Based on the user's input, follow this routine:
1. If you can answer the question directly using your knowledge, provide a clear and concise answer.
2. If the question requires gathering information or performing actions beyond your knowledge, create an information gathering plan.
3. After a plan is executed, you will automatically receive the results and can then formulate an appropriate answer to the question.
4. If the previous plan's results indicate a need for more information or refinement, create a new plan that builds upon the previous results.

Previous execution results (if any):
```
{previous_results}
```

Response format:
```
Respond with a JSON object that has the following keys:
- 'result': an object with the following keys:
    - 'type': either 'answer' or 'plan'
    - 'content': the content of the response, which depends on the type:
        - For 'answer': an object with 'message' and 'reason' keys
        - For 'plan': an object with a 'steps' key
Important: Make sure your response matches the format specified in the examples below.

Examples:

Answer:
{{
    "result": {{
        "type": "answer",
        "content": {{
            "message": "The capital of France is Paris.",
            "reason": "Direct answer based on general knowledge."
        }}
    }}
}}

Plan:
Notes for the 'plan' type response:
- Plans are for gathering information and performing actions only. After the plan executes, the results will be sent back to you automatically for formulating the final answer.
- Each step in the plan should either gather new information or process previously gathered information.
- Use 'required_for_response' to indicate which step's output contains the information you'll need to formulate your answer.
- Make sure to use the correct input format for each tool as specified in the tool descriptions.
- If this is a refinement plan, explain how it builds upon or corrects the previous plan's results.

Important: Each step must be an object with the following keys 'step', 'tool', 'input', 'reason', and 'required_for_response'.

Example Plan:
{{
    "type": "plan",
    "content": {{
        "steps": [
            {{
                "step": 1,
                "tool": "web-search_web",
                "input": {{
                    "query": "latest AI research papers 2024",
                    "search_type": "web",
                    "max_results": 5
